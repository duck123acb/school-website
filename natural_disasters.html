                  The topic I am researching is the land mine. Although it isn’t a natural disaster itself, it still affects more than 5500 people on average globally (mostly in countries like Myanmar, Syria, Afghanistan, Ukraine, and Yemen), with half of them being children; This being the case, it is clear that we must act to save and help as many people as possible. I am researching land mines because I initially did floods but them realized it was not allowed for this project, so I just chose the coolest option on the list of valid “natural disasters”. Lots of landmine software has been developed for military and research purposes, but in real life, the simulations are very limited and controlled (usually using inert devices).

                  Landmine accidents are primarily caused by human or animal interaction, often by accident. For example, the most common activities done while these casualties occur are collecting wood, paper, or metal, handling explosive devices, or playing with/around them. In countries of extreme poverty, some people hunt for the explosives and metal inside the landmines, only increasing risk and number of casualties. Moreover, the lack of funding for the proper upkeep of fences, signs, and warning about infected areas further increases the risk of a landmine accident occurring. Lastly, the different environmental and climate-related factors such as rain, wind, melting snow, and soil erosion can displace mines from their original positions and can cause even more accidents on top of the huge risk I have already established. In summary, there is a huge risk of landmine accidents in less developed countries, due to factors like being unaware, lack of funding, a lacking economy, and environmental factors.

                  When the military goes around clearing the ground of mines, there are a few main ways: Laser-Acoustic Detection, Magnetometers, and the classic Metal Detectors. First, Laser-Acoustic Detection works through sending a laser beam into the ground, which creates tiny vibrations. If there’s a buried object like a landmine, the way the vibrations bounce back will be different compared to normal soil. Sensitive microphones or sensors then pick up these changes, helping operators detect mines without needing to physically disturb the ground. Second, Magnetometers measure very small changes in the Earth’s magnetic field. Since many mines contain metal components, even small ones, the magnetometer can sense those disturbances and flag suspicious areas. Finally, Metal Detectors are the traditional method. They send an electromagnetic signal into the ground; when it hits metal, it induces a signal back into the detector, alerting the operator. While simple and effective, this method can be slowed down by false alarms from harmless bits of scrap metal.

                  The aftermath of a landmine accident is a tragic event which includes life-altering physical injuries, significant medical costs, and long-term psychological and economic consequences for survivors and their communities. Victims often suffer traumatic amputations, severe burns, shrapnel wounds to the torso and face, and internal injuries, with some requiring multiple surgeries and extensive rehabilitation. The financial burden is insane, with most cases costing hundreds of thousands USD in medical expenses. After the initial disaster, the long-term impact on survivors can include permanent disabilities, chronic pain, and ongoing medical needs. On the phycological side of things, the impact on survivors is profound, many having PTSD and requiring regular counseling. Overall, the aftermath of a landmine accident extends far beyond the initial injury, creating a cycle of physical, emotional, and financial hardship. Survivors are forced to adapt to new limitations, while families and communities must cope with the loss of productivity and the strain of providing care.

              After a landmine accident, recovery starts with emergency care for survivors, often involving many surgeries and rehabilitation. A real example is Cambodia, where decades of civil war left areas infested with hidden mines. Aid groups like the ICRC (International Committee of the Red Cross) helped by giving victims prosthetics, providing counseling, teaching people how to stay safe and avoid such areas. Recovery also involved clearing existing farmland so communities could grow food again and rebuilding roads and schools. Even after these efforts, long-term problems such as disability and poverty still remain. To help in recovery, rovers would need to move across rough ground, detect hidden mines with sensors, and safely remove or destroy them while keeping humans out of danger.
